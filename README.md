# Techdegree Project 1
 This project generates a random inspirational quote everytime the user clicks on the 'show another quote' button.
 Writing the functions to get the program to work was challenging, but by tackling each section at a time (and checking that everything was working as I go), I was able to get all functions to work as needed on the screen.
 This was a really fun project to do on my own. I was anxious as I was building it, but surprised myself with how well I was able to figure out a solution whenever I came into a roadblock.
